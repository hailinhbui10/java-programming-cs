# Java programming practice
My self-learning assignment for the course
[Programming with a Purpose](https://www.coursera.org/learn/cs-programming-java/)

## Learning Plan:

|                                          Week                                          |                                                 Assignment Program                                                 |  Assessment score (*)  |
|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|:----------------------:|
| [Week1](https://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/introcs/assignments/hello/specification.php) | - HelloWorld.java <br/> - HelloGoodbye.java<br/> - GreatCircle.java<br/>- RightTriangle.java<br/> - CMYKtoRGB.java | 100/100   (4 attempts) | 
| [Week2](https://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/introcs/assignments/loops/specification.php) |         - GeneralizedHarmonic.java<br/>- BandMatrix.java<br/>- RandomWalker.java<br/>- RandomWalkers.java          | 100 /100 (6 attempts)  |
| [Week3](https://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/introcs/assignments/loops/specification.php) |            - DiscreteDistribution.java<br/>- ThueMorse.java<br/>- Birthday.java<br/>- Minesweeper.java             |          /100          |

**(*)** In the course on Coursera, the assignment code was automatically graded by a comprehensive suite of tests which will analyze the program for correctness and style.

Each program is graded based on  Compilation, API, SpotBugs, PMD, Checkstyle, Correctness, Memory, and Timing.

I took advantages of this and kept submitting until I got the 100/100 since I think this is a good way to practice not only programming, but also to understand the program and to be able to optimize the algorithms

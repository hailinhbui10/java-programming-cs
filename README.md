# Java programming practice
My self-learning assignment for the course
[Programming with a Purpose](https://www.coursera.org/learn/cs-programming-java/)

## Learning Plan:

|                                          Week                                          |                                                 Assignment Program                                                 |  Assessment score (*, **)  |
|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|:----------------------:|
| [Week1: Introduction to Java](https://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/introcs/assignments/hello/specification.php) | - HelloWorld.java <br/> - HelloGoodbye.java<br/> - GreatCircle.java<br/>- RightTriangle.java<br/> - CMYKtoRGB.java | 100/100   (4 attempts) |

| [Week3: Arrays](https://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/introcs/assignments/loops/specification.php) |            - DiscreteDistribution.java<br/>- ThueMorse.java<br/>- Birthday.java<br/>- Minesweeper.java             |          /100          |

**(*)** In the course on Coursera, the assignment code was automatically graded by a comprehensive suite of tests that will analyze the program for correctness and style.

Each program is graded based on  Compilation, API, SpotBugs, PMD, Checkstyle, Correctness, Memory, and Timing.

I took advantage of this and kept submitting until I got the 100/100 since I think this is a good way to practice not only programming but also to understand the program and to be able to optimize the algorithms

**(\*\*)** Each week's assignment solution can be optimized even better using other Java features but we had to stick to the contents that we learned that week, otherwise some test categories failed.
